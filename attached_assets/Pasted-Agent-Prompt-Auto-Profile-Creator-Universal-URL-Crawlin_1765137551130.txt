Agent Prompt — Auto Profile Creator: Universal URL Crawling & AI Synthesis
Objective:
Build an AI-powered Universal Auto Profile Creator that takes any personal URL (e.g., a portfolio, website, or social link) and automatically constructs a rich creative profile of the person — including bio, photo, project list, credits, collaborators, and media embeds — sourced from verified public platforms.
🏗️ System Overview
Input Layer:
User provides any URL containing personal or professional information.
The system validates and standardizes the URL (resolves redirects, canonicalizes domain).
Crawler & Discovery Engine:
Crawl the provided URL and follow internal and outbound links up to a configurable depth (e.g., depth=3).
Prioritize pages likely containing profile or project data (/about, /projects, /portfolio, /filmography, etc.).
Extract structured and unstructured data:
Name, aliases, bio/description
Profile image(s)
Social links (IMDb, YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, LinkedIn, TMDB, OMDB)
Mentions of projects, collaborators, and roles
Cross-Platform Data Aggregation:
Identify and fetch data from known creative sources:
IMDb / TMDB / OMDB → project titles, roles, release years, cover art
YouTube / Vimeo → video titles, collaborators, thumbnails, upload year, embedded media
Facebook / LinkedIn → page metadata, description, team members (if available)
Use Perplexity SPA as the primary intelligent search layer to expand on incomplete data.
If Perplexity SPA fails or API rate limits occur, fallback to local scraping and offline crawling.
AI Identity Resolution (Gemini / LLM):
Input all gathered text + metadata into a synthesis prompt to infer:
Unified identity (name, summary, roles)
Condensed biography
Top projects with roles and collaborators
Key creative themes or styles
The AI should assign confidence scores to each inference.
If confidence < threshold (e.g., 0.7), the system should request another URL or trigger deeper crawl.
Profile Builder (Frontend):
Generate a cross-platform profile view using Next.js + Tailwind + Tabbs UI design:
Header: Name, profile picture, role, short bio
Project grid: title, year, cover image, platform badge (IMDb, YouTube, etc.)
Embedded media players (for videos/trailers)
“Source tags” for transparency (e.g., IMDb, YouTube)
Include fallback placeholder images for missing assets.
Storage & APIs:
Store structured data in a NoSQL DB (e.g., Firebase, MongoDB) or serverless function cache.
Each profile should be queryable via unique identifier or input URL hash.
Deployment & Documentation:
Deploy frontend + backend to Vercel
Repository hosted on GitHub (auto-profil-v2)
Include detailed README covering:
Data sources
Crawling depth
Confidence thresholds
Integration flow (Perplexity → Gemini → UI)
